      <strong>Deadline:</strong> 4 February 2019 <strong>before</strong> 4:00pm<br>
      <strong>Initial results:</strong> 6 February 2019<br>
      <strong>Re-submission with 20% deduction (optional):</strong> 8 February 2019 <strong>before</strong> 4:00pm (no lates accepted)<br>
    </p>

    <p><strong>What is re-submission?</strong> The assignment test
      results will typically be released within 48 hours of the
      deadline.  You may choose to resubmit, fixing any errors
      detected by our tests, or to submit a late submission without
      the benefit of tests.  These "re-submissions" will be accepted up
      until the deadline above with a 20% deduction. No late
      assignment re-submissions will be accepted (the assignment late
      penalty scheme does not apply to re-submissions).  Since a 20%
      penalty is applied and the highest mark a re-submission can
      receive is 80%, the re-submission is most commonly used by
      students whose code had a minor error that resulted in many test
      cases failing.  The majority of students do not and should not
      resubmit.

    <h2>Preamble: what is a problem domain?</h2>

    <p>A <em>problem domain</em> is an area of expertise that a
      programmer needs to understand in order to write a program
      related that domain. For example, if a programmer is hired by a
      non-profit organisation to help with their financial database,
      that programmer might have to learn how taxes apply to
      non-profit organisations, and then represent that knowledge in a
      working computer program.
    </p>
    
    <p>Every assignment in this course will have a problem domain that
      you will need to learn about, and the bulk of each assignment
      handout will describe that domain.
    </p>
    
    <p>The problem domain for this assignment is a Connect-N game.
      Most of this handout describes what that means, including how
      the problem domain concepts will be represented in your
      solution.  Please ask for help if something doesn't make sense
      to you!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Goals of this assignment</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Practice learning about a problem domain in order to write
	code about that domain.</li>
      <li>Use the Function Design Recipe to plan, implement, and test
	functions.</li>
      <li>Write function bodies that exercise the concepts of:
	variables; numeric, bool, and string types;
	operators/functions for numeric, bool, and string types; and
	conditional statements (if-statements). (You can do this whole
	assignment using only the concepts from Weeks 1, 2, and 3 of
	CSC108.)</li>
      <li>Learn to use Python 3 (version 3.7), Wing101, provided

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Connect-N</h2>

    <p>Connect-N is a generalised version of a game called Connect
      Four.  Each player has a symbol to play with (usually
      represented as <strong><code>R</code></strong>
      and <strong><code>B</code></strong>) and the goal is to be the
      first player to place <code>N</code> of their symbols in a
      straight line on the game board (either across a row, down a
      column, or diagonally).
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Wikipedia
      page for Connect-Four</a> (have a look!) provides a good
      description of the game and the rules.
    </p>
    
    <p>In this assignment, you are to complete some functions that
      make up part of a larger program for playing a simplified
      version of Connect-N.  The game will be played with
      an <code>M</code>-by-<code>M</code> board, where <code>M</code>
      is an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. A player will win when
      they place <code>N</code> symbols consecutively in a row, column
      or along a diagonal of the game board. Note that <code>N</code>
      may be smaller than <code>M</code> but may not be larger
      than <code>M</code>. Our game boards will <strong>always be
      square</strong>.  When you have completed your functions for
      this Assignment, you will be able to play games of Connect-N on
      your computer! The graphics won't be fancy, but we think that's
      okay, since the purpose of the assignment is to give you some
      practice with the parts of Python that you will learn in the
      first few weeks of the course.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Preliminary details and terminology</h2>

    <p>
      So far in the course, you have learned how to use variables to
      refer to objects that hold a single numerical or logical value,
      or a string of characters. For this assignment, we'll use what
      you've learned so far to write code that works with variables
      that refer to objects that represent game boards. We can think
      of our game boards as looking like this:
    </p>
    <pre>       R | B | R
      ---+---+---
         | B | R
      ---+---+---
       B | R |
    </pre>
    <p>To get started, we will need some terminology so that we can
      discuss Connect-N game boards and their parts.
    </p>
    
    <p>Let's describe the game board given above as being a 3-by-3
      grid of <strong>cell</strong>s. We will say that
      the <strong>game board size</strong> is 3, since the number of
      cells along each side of the board is 3.  Rows run horizontally
      across the board, and columns run vertically. There are two
      diagonals of length 3 on the board:
      the <strong><code>DOWN_RIGHT</code></strong> diagonal that runs
      from the upper-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and
      the <strong><code>DOWN_LEFT</code></strong> diagonal that runs
      from the upper-right corner to the bottom-left corner. The board
      also contains <code>DOWN_RIGHT</code> diagonals of length 2,
      and <code>DOWN_LEFT</code> diagonals of length 2.
    </p>
    
    <p>We will need a way to describe the position of each cell on the
      board.  This can be done by using an ordered pair of numbers,
      representing row and column indices.  In the example board
      above, the <strong>first row</strong> (the row with row index <code>1</code>)
      has a cell with an <code>R</code> (in the column with column
      index <code>1</code>), a cell with a <code>B</code> (column index <code>2</code>), and
      another cell with an <code>R</code> (column index <code>3</code>).
      The <strong>second column</strong> has two cells
      containing <code>B</code>'s (row indices <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>), and a cell
      containing an <code>R</code> (row index
      <code>3</code>). The <code>DOWN_RIGHT</code> diagonal of length
      3 contains, in order, an <code>R</code>, a <code>B</code> and an
      empty cell.  One of the two <code>DOWN_LEFT</code> diagonals of
      length 2 contains two <code>R</code>s. For each cell in our
      example 3-by-3 board, the row index will be
      either <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>, and
      the column index will also be
      either <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> or <code>3</code>.  The
      cell in position <code>(1, 2)</code> (row <code>1</code> and
      column <code>2</code>) contains a <code>B</code>, while the cell
      in position <code>(3, 3)</code> is empty. <strong>If at this
      point you are confused by the terminology, ask a question in
      class or on Piazza!</strong> You will have a hard time
      completing the assignment if you don't understand the terms that
      have been used!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Representing the game board</h2>

    <p>When representing a game board like the one above in a program,
      we only need to store the contents of each cell, not the divider
      symbols (i.e., <code>|</code>, <code>-</code>,
      and <code>+</code>) that are used to separate cells when game
      boards are displayed. This leaves us with a game board that
      looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>      RBR
       BR
      BR
    </pre>
    <p>It can be difficult to interpret boards that contain a lot of
      empty cells, so let's use the hyphen symbol <code>-</code> to
      fill empty cells, as shown below:
    </p>
    <pre>      RBR
      -BR
      BR-
    </pre>
    <p>We have not yet studied how to store 2-dimensional information
      in Python programs, so we will need a different way to represent
      our game board.  The approach that we will take for this
      Assignment is to store the rows one after another, starting with
      the first row. For the example board above, we would get:
    </p>
    <pre>      RBR-BRBR-
    </pre>
    <p>And how might we store this information? We will use a
      Python <code>str</code>.  With these choices, the Python
      statement:
    </p>
    <pre>      game_board = 'R-BR'
    </pre>
    <p>creates a variable named <code>game_board</code> that refers to
      the <code>str</code> object with length 4 <code>'R-BR'</code>,
      which represents a 2-by-2 game board that looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>       R | -
      ---+---
       B | R
    </pre>

    <h2>Accessing cells</h2>
    
    <p> We have used row <strong>and</strong> column indices to
      describe the position of each cell in the grid representation of
      a game board.  But each character in a Python <code>str</code>
      is in a position that is described by a single index.  How is
      the Python program going to translate between row and column
      indices and <code>str</code> indices? To answer this question,
      we will have to determine a formula!
    </p>
    
    <p>One good way to figure out the formula is to play with a
      concrete example. Suppose a game board was 4-by-4, and that each
      cell was filled with a different letter from A through P.  (Yes,
      in a real Connect-N game, only two symbols would be used, but
      for this example, it helps to put a different letter in each
      cell.) The grid representation could look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>      ABCD
      EFGH
      IJKL
      MNOP
    </pre>
    and then the <code>str</code> representation would look like this:
    <pre>      'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP'
    </pre>
    <p>Consider the same grid representation as above, with index
      labels added:
    </p>

    <div>
     <table class="normal">
      <caption>Game board grid with indices</caption>
      <tbody><tr>
	<th scope="col"></th>
	<th scope="col" colspan="4">column indices</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th scope="col">row indices</th>
	<th scope="col">1</th>
	<th scope="col">2</th>
	<th scope="col">3</th>
	<th scope="col">4</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th scope="row">1</th>
	<td>A</td>
	<td>B</td>
	<td>C</td>
	<td>D</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th scope="row">2</th>
	<td>E</td>
	<td>F</td>
	<td>G</td>
	<td>H</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th scope="row">3</th>
	<td>I</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th scope="row">4</th>
	<td>M</td>
	<td>N</td>
	<td>O</td>
	<td>P</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody></table>
    </div>

    <p>
      <br>
      ... and the string representation from above, again with index
      labels added, as well as the row and column information from the
      previous table:
    </p>

    <div>
    <table class="normal">
      <caption>(row, col) indices vs string indices</caption>
      <tbody><tr>
	<th>row, col</th>
	<td>1, 1</td>
	<td>1, 2</td>
	<td>1, 3</td>
	<td>1, 4</td>
	<td>2, 1</td>
	<td>2, 2</td>
	<td>2, 3</td>
	<td>2, 4</td>
	<td>3, 1</td>
	<td>3, 2</td>
	<td>3, 3</td>
	<td>3, 4</td>
	<td>4, 1</td>
	<td>4, 2</td>
	<td>4, 3</td>
	<td>4, 4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>str_index</th>
	<td>0</td>
	<td>1</td>
	<td>2</td>
	<td>3</td>
	<td>4</td>
	<td>5</td>
	<td>6</td>
	<td>7</td>
	<td>8</td>
	<td>9</td>
	<td>10</td>
	<td>11</td>
	<td>12</td>
	<td>13</td>
	<td>14</td>
	<td>15</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th></th>
	<td>A</td>
	<td>B</td>
	<td>C</td>
	<td>D</td>
	<td>E</td>
	<td>F</td>
	<td>G</td>
	<td>H</td>
	<td>I</td>
	<td>J</td>
	<td>K</td>
	<td>L</td>
	<td>M</td>
	<td>N</td>
	<td>O</td>
	<td>P</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    </div>

    <p><br>We now explore how <code>str_index</code> changes as we move
      across a row and down a column. This will help us determine a
      formula that relates row and column indices and <code>str</code>
      indices.
    </p>
    <p>In the example above, we see that the character in the cell
      with position <code>(2,1)</code> (cell with position row 2 and
      column 1) has <code>str_index</code> 4.  The other cells in that
      row have <code>str</code> indices 5, 6 and 7. We conclude that
      when moving one cell across a row, the <code>str_index</code>
      increases by 1.  The cells in the column with column index 3
      have <code>str</code> indices 2, 6, 10 and 14. Moving one cell
      down a column increases the <code>str_index</code> by 4, the
      size of the game board. We conclude that when moving one cell
      down a column, the <code>str_index</code> increases by the game
      board size.
    </p>
    <p>We now introduce variables that will allow us to express the
      formula explicitly.
    </p>
    <p>Let a variable named <code>str_index</code> refer to the
      position of a cell in the <code>str</code> representation of a
      game board with size <code>board_size</code>, and let
      variables <code>row_index</code> and <code>col_index</code>
      refer to the position of the same cell in the grid
      representation of a game board. From what we have seen, we can
      conclude that <code>str_index</code> depends
      on <code>row_index</code>, <code>col_index</code>
      and <code>board_size</code>.
    </p>
    <p>Plugging in a few examples will show that, given
      a <code>row_index</code>, <code>col_index</code>
      and <code>board_size</code>, the following formula will
      compute <code>str_index</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>      (row_index - 1) * board_size + (col_index - 1)
    </pre>
    <p>(The minus <code>1</code>'s are needed for the arithmetic to
      work out. This is because we chose to index our rows and columns
      starting at 1.  As a thought exercise, what would the formula be
      if we chose to index the rows and columns starting at 0?)
    </p>
    <p>Now that we have described how our game boards can be stored in
      a Python program, we move to a discussion of what files to
      download, and then a specification of the functions that you
      will need to write to complete your Assignment solution.
    </p>

    <h2 id="download">Files to Download</h2>
    
    <p>
      Please download the <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a1/a1.zip">Assignment 1 Files</a> and
      extract the zip archive. The following paragraphs explain the
      files you have been given.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Starter code: <code>connect_n_functions.py</code></h3>
    <p>
      This file contains some constants, the header and the complete
      docstring (but not body!) for the first function you are to
      write.  You will update this file to include the complete
      functions that you write.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Starter code: <code>connect_n_program.py</code></h3>
    <p>
      This file contains the main program and when it is run, the
      functions that you wrote and put in
      the <code>connect_n_functions.py</code> file will be called. <strong>Do
      not</strong> make any changes to the <code>connect_n_program.py</code>
      file. You will be able to understand most of this code by week six.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Checker: <code>a1_simple_checker.py</code></h3>
    <p>
      We have provided a checker program that you should use to check
      your code. See below for more information
      about <code>a1_simple_checker.py</code>
    </p>

    <h2 id="constants">
      Constants
    </h2>
    <p>
      Constants are special variables whose values do not change once
      assigned. A different naming convention (uppercase pothole) is
      used for constants, so that programmers know to not change their
      values. For example, in the starter code, the
      constant <code>EMPTY</code> is assigned the
      value <code>'-'</code> at the beginning of the module and the
      value of <code>EMPTY</code> should never change in your code.
      When writing your code, if you need to refer to the symbol used
      to show that a cell has not yet been chosen, you should
      use <code>EMPTY</code>, rather than '-'. The same principle must
      be used when the value of the other constants are used in your
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using constants simplifies code modifications and improves
      readability. If we later decide to use a different symbol in a
      non-selected cell, we would only have to change the symbol in
      one place (the <code>EMPTY</code> assignment statement), rather
      than making changes throughout the program.
    </p>

    <p>The starter code provides the following constants for you to
      use:
    </p>

    <div>
      <table>
	<caption>Constants provided in the starter code</caption>

          <th style="text-align:left">Constant</th>

          <td><code>DOWN</code></td>
          <td><code>ACROSS</code></td>
          <td><code>DOWN_RIGHT</code></td>
          <td><code>DOWN_LEFT</code></td>
          <td><code>MAX_BOARD_SIZE</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

          <td><code>'-'</code></td>
          <td><code>'down'</code></td>
          <td><code>'across'</code></td>
          <td><code>'down_right'</code></td>
          <td><code>'down_left'</code></td>
          <td><code>9</code></td>

    <h2>
      What to do
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the starter code file <code>connect_n_functions.py</code>,
      complete the following function definitions. We expect you to
      use the Function Design Recipe from the Week 2 PCRS Prepare
      videos, and to write complete docstrings for each function.
    </p>
    <p>We have included the type contracts in the table below.  We
      will be evaluating your docstrings in addition to your code.
      You must include two examples in your docstrings. You will need
      to paraphrase the full descriptions of the functions to get an
      appropriate docstring description; copying and pasting what you
      see in the table below is not sufficient.  Check the steps of
      the Function Design Recipe to make sure you have properly
      paraphrased.
    </p>
    <p>You may care to read through <code>connect_n_program.py</code>
      to see how the functions that you will write can be used.  The
      code in the <code>connect_n_program.py</code> file uses Python
      statements that you may not have learned yet, so don't worry if
      you do not understand it fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>connect_n_functions.py</code> starter code file starts
      with the definition of a few constant variables
      (see <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a1/index.shtml#constants">above</a>) and a complete docstring
      for the <code>between</code> function. In your Assignment 1
      solution, <strong>do not</strong> change the code that we have
      provided. You are to <strong>add your Python statements</strong>
      to this starter code file and fulfil the requirements listed in
      the table below.
    </p>
    
    <table class="normal">

          The first parameter refers to an <code>int</code> value, the
          second to the minimum value for a range of values, and the
          third to the maximum value for a range of values. Assume
          that the value of the second parameter is less than or equal
          to the value of the third parameter. (That means that, when
          you write your code, you don't need to worry about other
          situations. As always, the assumptions should be described
          in a precondition.) This function is to
          return <code>True</code> if and only if the value of the
          first parameter is not less than the second parameter and
          not more than the third parameter. In other
          words, <code>True</code> is returned if and only if the
          first parameter is between the second and third parameters,
          or equal to one or both of them.

    <h3>No Input or Output!</h3>

    <p>
      Your <code>connect_n_functions.py</code> file should contain the
      starter code, plus the function definitions specified above.
      <code>connect_n_functions.py</code> must <em>not</em> include
      any calls to the <code>print</code> and <code>input</code>
      functions.  Do <em>not</em> add any <code>import</code>
      statements.  Also, do <em>not</em> include any function calls or
      other code outside of the function definitions.
    </p>

    <h3>
      How should you test whether your code works?
    </h3>
    <p>
      First, run the checker and review <u>ALL</u> output — you
      may need to scroll.  You should also test each function
      individually by writing code to verify your functions in the
      Python shell.  For example, after defining
      function <code>game_board_full</code>, you might call it from
      the shell (e.g., <code>game_board_full('BRRRBRRBB')</code>) to
      check whether it returns the right value (<code>True</code>).
      One call usually isn't enough to thoroughly test the function
      — for example, we should also
      test <code>game_board_full('B-BR-RB-B')</code> where it should
      return <code>False</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've checked each function individually, play the game by
      running the <code>connect_n_program.py</code> starter code to
      see whether it works as expected. If not, go back to testing the
      functions individually.  It is part of the assignment for you to
      decide which tests to use.

    <h2>
      CSC108 A1 Checker
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are providing a checker module (<code>a1_simple_checker.py</code>) that
      tests two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	whether your functions have the correct parameter and return
	types, and
      </li>
      <li> whether your code follows the Python and CSC108
        <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a1/python_style_guide.shtml">style guidelines</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To run the checker, open <code>a1_simple_checker.py</code> and
      run it.  Note: the checker file should be in
      the <strong>same</strong> directory as
      your <code>connect_n_functions.py</code>, as provided in the
      starter code zip file.  Be sure to scroll through and read all
      messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>If the checker passes for both style and types:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Your function parameters and return types match the
        assignment specification. <strong>This does not mean that your
          code works correctly in all situations.</strong> We will run
        additional tests on your code once you hand it in, so be
        sure to thoroughly test your code yourself before
        submitting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your code follows the style guidelines.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>If the checker fails, carefully read the message provided:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	It may have failed because one or more of your parameter or
	return types does not match the assignment specification, or
	because a function is misnamed. Read the error message to
	identify the problematic function, review the function
	specification in the handout, and fix your code.
      </li>
      <li>
	It may have failed because your code did not follow the style
	guidelines.  Review the error description(s) and fix the code
	style.  Please see
	the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/pyta/">PyTA
	documentation</a> for more information about errors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Make sure the checker passes before submitting.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Marking
    </h2>

    <p>
      These are the aspects of your work that may be marked for A1:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Correctness (80%):</strong> Your functions should perform as
        specified. Correctness, as measured by our tests, will count
        for the largest single portion of your marks.  Once your
        assignment is submitted, we will run additional tests not
        provided in the checker. Passing the checker <strong>does not</strong>
        mean that your code will earn full marks for correctness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coding style (20%):</strong> Make sure that you follow
        Python <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a1/python_style_guide.shtml">style
        guidelines</a> that we have introduced and the Python coding
        conventions that we have been using throughout the semester.
        Although we don't provide an exhaustive list of style rules,
        the checker tests for style are complete, so if your code
        passes the checker, then it will earn full marks for coding
        style with one exception: docstrings may be evaluated
        separately. For each occurrence of a PyTA error, one mark (out
        of 20) deduction will be applied.  For example, if a C0301
        (line-too-long) error occurs 3 times, then 3 marks will be
        deducted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
      What to Hand In
    </h2>
    <p style="color:brown; font-weight: bold;">The very last thing
      you do before submitting should be to run the checker program
      one last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, you could make a small error in your final changes
      before submitting that causes your code to receive zero for
      correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Submit <code>connect_n_functions.py</code> on MarkUs by
      following the instructions on the course website. Remember that
      spelling of filenames, including case, counts: your file must be
      named exactly as above.
