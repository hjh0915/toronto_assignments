      <strong>Deadline:</strong> Monday, March 11, 2019 
      <strong>before</strong> 4:00pm<br>
      <strong>Initial results:</strong> Wednesday, March 13, 2019<br>
      <strong>Re-submission with 20% deduction (optional):</strong> 
      Friday, March 15, 2019 <strong>before</strong> 4:00pm 
      (no lates accepted)<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is re-submission?</strong> The assignment test
      results will typically be released within 48 hours of the
      deadline. You may choose to resubmit, fixing any errors
      detected by our tests, or to submit a late submission without
      the benefit of tests. These "re-submissions" will be accepted up
      until the deadline above with a 20% deduction. No late
      assignment re-submissions will be accepted (the assignment late
      penalty scheme does not apply to re-submissions). Since a 20%
      penalty is applied and the highest mark a re-submission can
      receive is 80%, the re-submission is most commonly used by
      students whose code had a minor error that resulted in many test
      cases failing. The majority of students do not and should not
      resubmit.

    <h2>Goals of this assignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Continue to practice learning about a problem domain in
	order to write code about that domain.</li>
      <li>Continue to use the Function Design Recipe to plan,
	implement, and test functions.</li>
      <li>Design and write function bodies using loops (over strings
	  and lists) and string and list manipulation. (You can do
	  this whole assignment with only the concepts from Weeks 1
	  through 6 of CSC108.)</li>
      <li>Practice good programming style.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>DNA Manipulation</h2>
    <p>
      Computer science concepts can be applied to solve problems in
      many different domains. In this assignment, the problem domain
      is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you read the rest of the handout, please go read
      about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/dna.shtml">the DNA problem domain</a>.

    <h2>What To Do</h2>
    <p>
      In this assignment, you will add your work to two different files.
      The first file is named <code>palindromes.py</code> and you will
      add your code to implement the required functions
      listed in the table under <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/index.shtml#task1">Task 1</a> below.
      The second file is named <code>dna.py</code> and you will
      add your code to implement the required functions
      listed in the table under <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/index.shtml#task2">Task 2</a> below.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id="download">Files to Download</h3>
    
    <p>
      Please download the <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/a2.zip">Assignment 2 Files</a> and
      extract the zip archive. In the sections below we describe the
      functions that you will add to the starter files.
    </p>

    <p style="color: red;">
      (Students who downloaded the zip file before 10:40am on Sunday, Feb 24th
      should download the 
      <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/a2_simple_checker.py">revised a2_simple_checker.py</a> file
      and replace the original file with the revised version.)
    </p>

    <h3>CSC108 A2 Checker</h3>
    <p>
      As with Assignment 1, we have provided a checker
      module, <code>a2_simple_checker.py</code>, which you can and
      should run on your code as you work. You are responsible for
      doing thorough testing of your own code and making sure it works
      correctly, but the checker is a good first step. Make sure you
      use it!
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="task1">Task 1: Regular Palindromes</h2>
    <p>
      To help you get warmed up, the first part of this assignment asks you
      to write code that deals with regular (not DNA) palindromes.
      According to the Oxford Dictionary, a
      <em>palindrome</em> is "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads
      the same backward as forward."  For example, the phrases
      "<em>Madam, I'm Adam.</em>" and "<em>nurses run</em>" are palindromes.
      Notice from these examples that blanks and punctuation are
      ignored when considering whether or not a phrase is a palindrome.
      We also ignore digits. Only alphabetic characters are examined
      when determining whether or not a string is a palindrome.
      The word "<em>radar</em>" is an odd-length palindrome, and
      "<em>toot</em>" is an even-length palindrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      In file <code>palindromes.py</code>, complete the function
      definitions for the functions listed in the table below. Use the
      function design recipe that you have been learning. We have
      included the type contracts in the table. Please read through
      the table to understand how the functions will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Come up with your own examples.</strong> It's part of
      the process of understanding the domain, and is a skill any
      computer programmer needs.

            The parameter is a string that may or may not be a
            palindrome. Return <code>True</code> if and only if the
            parameter is a palindrome, independent of letter case and
            ignorning non-alphabetic characters. To be clear,
            non-alphabetic characters should be ignored (that is,
            treated as if they are not present), and uppercase
            letters should be considered to be equal to their
            lowercase equivalents.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hint:</strong> Before writing code, write the
            phrase "Madam I'm Adam." on a piece of paper. This phrase is
            a palindrome. Think about the steps that you need to go through
            in order to confirm that it is a palindrome, and then think about
            how you can express those steps in code.

    <h2 id="task2">Task 2: DNA palindromes and restriction enzymes</h2>
    <p>
      This part of the assignment deals with DNA palindromes and
      restriction enzymes. Complete the function definitions for the
      functions listed in the table below in <code>dna.py</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tasks performed by these functions overlap — you should
      identify and call some of these functions from other functions
      as helpers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>dna.py</code> file that was provided for download contains
      a helper function named <code>get_complementary_base()</code> and 
      some constants.  You are encouraged to use them in your code.

  <b>Answer</b>: Yes it should, but the list of indices associated with
  the enzyme should be an empty list. The length of the list returned by
  match_enzymes must be the same as the length of the two parallel lists

      Use the function design recipe process that we've been
      practicing. <em>In a new problem domain with tricky functions
      this is particularly important.</em> You need to be confident
      that you know what you are implementing before you start writing
      code. Come up with multiple examples — with expected
      return values — before you start coding. If you're not
      sure whether an example you've created is correct, you're
      welcome to post it on the discussion board to get feedback.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Want to earn a good mark? Test your work!</h2>
    <p>
      You should carefully verify your code <em>before submitting</em>
      to determine whether it works: the Test step of the Function
      Design Recipe is particularly important for assignments. Once
      the deadline has passed, we will run our own set of tests on
      your submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      To test your work, you should call on each function with a
      variety of different arguments and check that the function
      returns the correct value in each case. This can be done in the
      shell or using another <code>.py</code> file, but must not be
      done in your submitted <code>.py</code> files.
    </p>
    <h2>No Input or Output!</h2>
    <p>
      Your <code>palindromes.py</code> and <code>dna.py</code> files
      should contain the starter code, plus the function definitions
      specified above. These files must <em>not</em> include any
      calls to the <code>print</code> and <code>input</code>
      functions. Do <em>not</em> add any <code>import</code>
      statements. Also, do <em>not</em> include any function calls or
      any other code outside of the function definitions.
    </p>
    <h2>CSC108 A2 Checker</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of the simple checker is to help you make sure that
      we will be able to test your code, and to check your code for
      style errors. To use the checker, make sure
      that <code>a2_simple_checker.py</code>, <code>palindromes.py</code>,
      <code>dna.py</code>, and the <code>pyta</code> directory are all
      in the same directory, <strong>exactly as they were in the zip
      file we provide</strong>, and
      run <code>a2_simple_checker.py</code>. Be sure to scroll through
      and read all messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The checker tests two things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        whether your functions have the correct parameter and return
        types, and
      </li>
      <li> whether your code follows the Python and CSC108
        <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/python_style_guide.shtml">style guidelines</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>If the checker passes for both style and types:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your function parameters and return types match the
        assignment specification. <strong>This does not mean that your
        code works correctly in all situations.</strong> We will run
        additional tests on your code once you hand it in, so be
        sure to thoroughly test your code yourself before
        submitting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your code follows the style guidelines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>If the checker fails, carefully read the message provided:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It may have failed because one or more of your parameter or
        return types does not match the assignment specification, or
        because a function is misnamed. Read the error message to
        identify the problematic function, review the function
        specification in the handout, and fix your code.
      </li>
      <li>
        It may have failed because your code did not follow the style
        guidelines. Review the error description(s) and fix the code
        style. Please see
        the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/pyta/">PyTA
        documentation</a> for more information about errors.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Make sure the checker passes before submitting.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Marking</h2>
    <p>
      These are the aspects of your work that may be marked for A2:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Correctness (80%):</strong> Your functions should perform as
        specified. Correctness, as measured by our tests, will count
        for the largest single portion of your marks. Once your
        assignment is submitted, we will run additional tests not
        provided in the checker. Passing the checker <strong>does not</strong>
        mean that your code will earn full marks for correctness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Coding style (20%):</strong> Make sure that you follow
        Python <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a2/python_style_guide.shtml">style
        guidelines</a> that we have introduced and the Python coding
        conventions that we have been using throughout the semester.
        Although we don't provide an exhaustive list of style rules,
        the checker tests for style are complete, so if your code
        passes the checker, then it will earn full marks for coding
        style with one exception: docstrings may be evaluated
        separately. For each occurrence of a PyTA error, one mark (out
        of 20) deduction will be applied. For example, if a C0301
        (line-too-long) error occurs 3 times, then 3 marks will be
        deducted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What to Hand In</h2>
    <p style="color:brown; font-weight: bold;">The very last thing
      you do before submitting should be to run the checker program
      one last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, you could make a small error in your final changes
      before submitting that causes your code to receive zero for
      correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submit <code>palindromes.py</code> and <code>dna.py</code> on
      MarkUs by following the instructions on the course
      website. Remember that spelling of filenames, including case,
      counts: your files must be named exactly as above.
