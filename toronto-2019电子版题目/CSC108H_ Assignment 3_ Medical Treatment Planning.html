      <strong>We are pretty good at detecting cheating.</strong> We
      hate finding it, though, so we have written this short guide on
      how to avoid being interviewed by us for an academic offence.

    <p>
      A typical penalty for a first offence is a <strong>zero on the
        assignment</strong>. The case will also be entered into
      the <strong>UofT academic offence database</strong>. (If you
      get caught a second time ever as an undergrad, the penalties
      are much, much more severe.)

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In this assignment, you will write a program to recommend medical
    treatments based on the clinical attributes of a
    patient. You will be using the invasive Breast Carcinoma (BRCA)
    dataset from 
     <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga">
     The Cancer Genome (TCGA) Atlas</a>.
    In the provided files for this assignment, there is a filtered version of
    data from <a target="_blank" href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/tcga/?">TCGA Data Portal</a>
    that is based on data generated by the 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga">TCGA Research Network</a>.
  </p>

   <p>We will be predicting a treatment using 
     <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search">
     nearest neighbour search</a>.
     The algorithm will predict a treatment (or treatments) based on the
     treatments given to patients with the most "similar" patient profiles. 
  </p>

  <h2>Goals of this assignment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Continue to practice learning about a problem domain in
      order to write code about that domain.</li>
    <li>Continue to use the Function Design Recipe to plan,
      implement, and test functions.</li>
    <li>Design and write function bodies, with focus on using files,
      type dictionary, and dictionary methods.</li>
    <li>Practice good programming style.</li>
    <li>Design and write unittest test suites to test your functions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="starter_code">Starter Code</h2>

  <p>
    Please download the <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a3/a3.zip">Assignment 3 Files</a> and
    extract the zip archive. In the sections below we explain the
    starter code and describe the functions that you will add to the
    starter files.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Files</h3>
  
  <p>Four different data files have been prepared for you to work 
     with in this assignment.
  </p>
  <ul>
     <li> <code>medical_data.tsv</code> contains
       clinical information about more than one thousand patients. 
       </li>
     <li> 
       <code>medical_data_small.tsv</code> contains information about sixteen
       patients.
       </li>
     <li> <code>medical_data_three.tsv</code> contains
       information about three patients.
     </li><li> <code>new_patients.tsv</code> contains information about ten patients
       without a treatment plan.  A goal of the assignment is to write code
       that may be used to suggest treatment plan(s) for these patients.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>The data is formatted as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values"><em>tab separated values</em></a>
     (TSV). That means that the information in each line in the file is 
     separated by a tab character (<code>'\t'</code>).
     The first line in the file contains the names of the patient attributes.
     Each subsequent line contains information for one patient. 
     The first piece of information in the line is a patient id. The rest
     of the line contains the patient's values for each of the attributes. Some values may have the special value <code>NA</code>,
    which stands for "Not Available".
  </p>
  <p>
     For example, the first two lines in <code>medical_data.tsv</code>
     are the following strings:
  </p>

  <pre>'Patient_ID\tAge\tGender\tTumor_Size\tNearby_Cancer_Lymphnodes\tCancer_Spread\tHistological_Type\tLymph_Nodes\tTreatment\n'
'tcga.5l.aat0\t42\tfemale\tt2\tn0\tm0\th_t_1\t0\tplan_1\n'
  </pre>
  <p>
     Expanding the tab characters into whitespace and lining up the columns gives this tabular format:
  </p>
  <pre>Patient_ID     Age    Gender    Tumor_Size    Nearby_Cancer_Lymphnodes    Cancer_Spread    Histological_Type     Lymph_Nodes    Treatment
tcga.5l.aat0   42     female    t2            n0                          m0               h_t_1                 0              plan_1
  </pre>


  <div style="float:right; width: 50%; border: 2px solid black; margin-left:10px; padding:5px; background-color:#aef7e2">
    <h2>You should design helper functions!</h2>
    <p>
      Any time that you find that your code has become too complicated, try 
      to identify a small task that could be solved by a separate function.
      Ask yourself the question ``Are there a few lines of code that are 
      trying to solve a single, simple task?'' If the answer to that question 
      is ``yes'', try isolating those lines in a helper function.  Doing so
      will help you to write correct code more quickly. One place to start
      is to try to understand the structure of the data in the files. For
      example, writing separate function(s) to process different parts of the 
      input file is one way to simplify the task of processing the whole file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the everyday experience of programming is figuring out&nbsp;what code
      to put into a helper function, what information the helper function
      needs to do its job, where the information comes from and how it is
      stored, and the resulting parameter types. You'll get better at this task
      with practice. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Required Functions: treatment_functions.py</h3>

  <p>The file <code>treatment_functions.py</code> contains the headers
    for the functions you need to write for this assignment. You
    should follow the Function Design Recipe to implement each 
    function. You are encouraged to create helper functions in this
    file that are called by the required functions.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Required Testcases: test_missing_values.py</h3>

  <p>
    The file <code>test_missing_values.py</code> contains 
    the start to a unittest testfile for the function 
    <code>test_missing_values.py</code>. You will add
    appropriate unittests for this function to this file. 
  </p>

  <h3>Constants: constants.py</h3>

  <p>
    The file <code>constants.py</code> contains some constants that
    you must use in your program. Make sure you do <strong>not</strong>
    change them!
  </p>

          Information about a group of patients is stored in an
          <code>ID_TO_ATTRIBUTES</code> dictionary.
	  It is a
	  dictionary that maps patient IDs to a corresponding dictionary 
          that stores that patient's data. For example, the information

  </tbody></table>

  <h2 id="similarities">Computing the Similarity</h2>

  <p>
    Here is how we compute the similarity between two patients.  The
    total similarity score is the sum of the similarity scores for
    each of the patient's attributes.  Each attribute similarity score
    is determined as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If either patient has an attribute value of <code>NA</code> (not
      available), the similarity score for the attribute
      is <code>0.5</code>.</li>
    <li>
      If the two attribute values are numeric, the similarity score
      for the attribute is<pre>1 / ( (the absolute difference of the values) + 1 ).
    </pre>
  </li>
    <li>
      Otherwise, the similarity score for the attribute
      is <code>0.0</code> if the two patient attribute values are
      different or <code>1.0</code> if the two patient attribute
      values are the same.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For example, if the two patients have the following data:
  </p>
  <pre>{'Age': '42', 'Gender': 'female', 'Tumor_Size': 't2', 'Nearby_Cancer_Lymphnodes': 'n0',
 'Cancer_Spread': 'm0', 'Histological_Type': 'NA', 'Lymph_Nodes': '0'}

{'Age': '51', 'Gender': 'male', 'Tumor_Size': 't2','Nearby_Cancer_Lymphnodes': 'n0',
'Cancer_Spread': 'm0', 'Histological_Type': 'h_t_2', 'Lymph_Nodes': '0'},
  </pre>
  <p>
    then the similarity measure of these two patients is (rounded to 2 decimal places after the decimal point):
  </p>
  <pre>    (1/(abs(51-42)+1)) + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + (1/(abs(0-0)+1)) = 4.60
  </pre>

    <h3>Required Functions</h3>

  <p>
    This section contains a table of detailed descriptions of the
    functions you must complete.  These are the functions that we will
    be testing. However, you should follow the approach we've been
    using on large problems recently and write additional helper
    functions to break down tasks and make your functions smaller and
    more concise. Each helper function must have a clear purpose. Each
    helper function must have a complete docstring produced by
    following the Function Design Recipe. You should test your helper
    functions to make sure they work.

	  The function should return a list of 
          <strong>unique</strong> values for the
	  attribute named <code>TREATMENT</code>, in the following
	  order. The first value should be the treatment for the patient
	  from <code>ID_TO_ATTRIBUTES</code> that has the greatest
	  similarity with the patient
	  in <code>NAME_TO_VALUE</code>. The second value should be
	  the treatment for the patient with the second greatest similarity, and
	  so on. If some patient has the value <code>NA</code> for the
	  attribute name <code>TREATMENT</code>, this treatment is not
	  included in the list of recommendations. Treatments should not
          be repeated in the returned list.

	  The first parameter is an <code>ID_TO_ATTRIBUTES</code> that

	  attribute with the first recommended treatment, as
	  computed by the
	  function <code>treatment_recommendations</code>.

  <h2>Required Testing</h2>

  <p>Implement unittests for the function
    <code>patients_with_missing_values</code>. These tests should be
    implemented in the file <code>test_missing_values.py</code>. The
    starter file is provided with the starter code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure your tests are exhaustive. We will grade this part of
    the assignment by running your tester on faulty implementations of
    the function <code>patients_with_missing_values</code> and seeing
    how many bugs your tester detects.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Do <strong>not</strong>
      call <code>print</code>, <code>input</code>,
      or <code>open</code>, except within the <code> if __name__ ==
	'__main__'</code> block.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do <strong>not</strong> modify or add to the import statements
      provided in the starter code.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do <strong>not</strong> add any code outside of a function
      definition or the <code> if __name__ == '__main__'</code> block.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do <strong>not</strong> use any global variables (other than
      constants).
    </li>
    <li>
      Do <strong>not</strong> mutate objects unless specified.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Marking</h2>
  <p>
    These are the aspects of your work that will be marked for
    Assignment 3:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Correctness (70%):</strong> Your functions should
      perform as specified. Correctness, as measured by our tests,
      will count for the largest single portion of your marks. Once
      your assignment is submitted, we will run additional tests, not
      provided in the checker. Passing the checker <strong>does
      not</strong> mean that your code will earn full marks for
      correctness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Testing (10%):</strong> We will run
      the <code>unittests</code> that you submit on a series of flawed
      (incorrect) implementations we have written. Your testing mark
      will depend on how many of the flawed implementations your
      unittests catch, whether they successfully pass a working
      (correct) implementation, and whether your test files contain
      redundant (unnecessary) tests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Coding style (20%): </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure that you
          follow <a href="https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc108h/winter/assignments/a3/python_style_guide.shtml">Python style
          guidelines</a> that we have introduced and the Python coding
          conventions that we have been using throughout the
          semester. Although we don't provide an exhaustive list of
          style rules, the checker tests for style are complete, so if
          your code passes the checker, then it will earn full marks
          for coding style with two exceptions: docstrings and use of
          helper functions may be evaluated separately. For each
          occurrence of
          a <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/pyta/" target="_blank">PyTA error</a>, a 1 mark (out of 20)
          deduction will be applied. For example, if a C0301
          (line-too-long) error occurs 3 times, then 3 marks will be
          deducted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your program should be broken down into functions, both to
          avoid repetitive code and to make the program easier to
          read. If a function body is more than about 20 lines long,
          introduce helper functions to do some of the work —
          even if they will only be called once.
        </li>
        <li>
          All functions, including helper functions, should have
          complete docstrings including preconditions when you think
          they are necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, your variable names and names of your helper functions
          should be meaningful. Your code should be as simple and
          clear as possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  
  <h2>What to Hand In</h2>
  <p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold;">
    The very last thing you do before submitting should be to run the
    checker program one last time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Otherwise, you could make a small error in your final changes
    before submitting that causes your code to receive zero for
    correctness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Submit <code>treatment_functions.py</code>
    and <code>test_missing_values.py</code> on MarkUs by following the
    instructions on the syllabus. Remember that spelling of filenames,
    including case, counts: your file must be named exactly as above.
